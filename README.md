# OperatingParameterManager Readme

`WizardWrx.OperatingParameterManager.dll` and its NuGet package,
`WizardWrx.OperatingParameterManager`, expose a set of classes that enable any
desktop program that targets the Microsoft .NET Framework to process command
line arguments (parameters) that must pass a set of validation rules, all of
which are taken from a text resource that is embedded in the entry assembly.
